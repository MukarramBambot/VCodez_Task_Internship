### SmartInvoice
Project: Sales Invoice Table (Internship Assignment)

# Description
This project demonstrates the creation of a sales invoice table using HTML and CSS. I, Mukarram Bambot, built this as a practice task during my internship at VCODEZ. The assignment involved digitizing a real-world invoice into a clean and responsive web format, suitable for integration into business dashboards or customer portals.

# Features
- Professional invoice table design with company and customer details

- Clearly itemized product list with quantity, price, subtotal, tax, and grand total

- Clean, readable layout and minimal CSS styling for broad compatibility

# Purpose
To showcase front-end skills, including HTML structure, semantic markup, and basic styling, matching a provided real-world document. This task highlights my ability to translate business requirements into functional web content, a valuable asset for roles in web development and business automation.

# Usage
You can open the HTML file in any web browser or integrate it as a component in larger web projects. All company and customer data are sample placeholders for demonstration purposes.
