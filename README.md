# ⭐ Task 11 – Star Pattern Programs in Python

This task is part of my **Full Stack Developer (Python) Internship at VCodez**.  
Task 11 focuses on creating different **pattern-based programs** using loops in Python.  
The objective is to understand how nested loops, spacing, and string repetition work together to form structured patterns.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To write Python programs that generate multiple star patterns using:
- For loops  
- Nested loops  
- Spacing & alignment  
- Controlled formatting  

---

## 🧠 Patterns Implemented
The following patterns were created in this task (outputs not included as required):

1. **Right Triangle Pattern**  
2. **Inverted Right Triangle Pattern**  
3. **Full Pyramid Pattern**  
4. **Inverted Full Pyramid Pattern**  
5. **Parallelogram Pattern**

Each pattern is created by adjusting:
- Loop range  
- Space alignment  
- Star placement  
- Indentation control  

---

## 📂 File Included
✔️ **Sample.py**  
Contains the Python implementations of all patterns mentioned above.

---

## 🧩 What I Learned
- How to use nested loops effectively  
- How spacing and alignment impact structured output  
- Logic building through pattern creation  
- Writing cleaner and modular loop-based programs
