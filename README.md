# 🧮 Task 10 – Python Real-Time Examples (Elif & Nested If)

This task is part of my **Full Stack Developer (Python) Internship at VCodez**.  
Task 10 focuses on implementing **real-time decision-making programs** using:

- `elif` statements  
- Nested `if` statements  

These examples simulate real-world logic such as **grading systems** and **ATM withdrawal rules**.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To write Python programs that:

- Use conditional decision-making (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Implement nested conditional checks
- Mimic real-world scenarios requiring multiple conditions
- Handle user inputs effectively  

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

✔ Real-time decision making using conditional statements  
✔ How `elif` helps simplify multiple conditions  
✔ How nested `if` helps validate multiple constraints  
✔ User input handling using `input()`  
✔ Printing meaningful and structured outputs

## 🧩 Program Sections

### **1️⃣ Grading System (using `elif`)**
A student enters marks (0–100), and the program prints the grade:

| Marks Range | Grade | Meaning |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| 90+         | A+     | Excellent |
| 75–89       | A      | Very Good |
| 60–74       | B      | Good |
| 45–59       | C      | Needs Improvement |
| Below 45    | Fail   | Try Again |

This teaches:
- Ordered conditions  
- Multiple comparisons  
- A realistic grading model  

---

### **2️⃣ ATM Withdrawal System (Nested If Example)**

Simulates an ATM machine with:

- **Initial balance:** ₹5000  
- Withdrawal only allowed if:
  - Amount ≤ balance  
  - Amount is a multiple of ₹100  

This program demonstrates:
- Nested decision making  
- Validating multiple conditions  
- Updating balance  
- Real-time transaction flow  

---

## 📂 File Included

### ✔️ `Sample.py`
Contains both programs:

- **Grading System using `elif`**
- **ATM Withdrawal using Nested `if`**

Each block is clearly separated with printed separators for readability.

## 🖥️ Features Demonstrated

- ✔ Real-world logic implementation  
- ✔ Clean decision trees  
- ✔ Input validation  
- ✔ Error handling concepts  
- ✔ Python condition optimization
